This December, I will write a story every day of Advent. It can be in any form: a comedy sketch, a bit of stand-up, a scene for a play, a monologue, or a short bit of prose.

On this page, all links to written entries will appear.

- December 1st (Oops, I started a day too late... Hopefully I will catch up soon.)
- [December 2nd](advent_of_stories_day_02/)

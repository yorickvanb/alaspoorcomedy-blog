```
EXT. JUNGLE, DAY

In a small bush in the jungle, a young ZOOMER is collecting specimens, wearing a tropical helmet. Suddenly a PLUCHY SNAKE appears near his hand. It wobbles in a goofy way and makes obviously fake HISSING sounds, like a hand is holding it off camera. Then it bites the ZOOMER. He screams and falls to the ground. The SNAKE disappears into the bushes, obivously pulled along by a string.

ZOOMER
Aaaaah! ... I must... call for help...

ZOOMER reaches into his pocket, grabs out his phone. We see on the screen he is about to call the PROFESSOR, but then changes his mind. We hear his THOUGHTS.

ZOOMER THOUGHTS
But what if he's busy? I can't just bother him for no reason. Better text him.

ZOOMER types out a Whatsapp message to PROFESSOR:

"I got bitten by a dangerous pink snake. Can you come with the anti-venom?"

He sends the message. We see a double grey checkmark. The message has been "Delivered", but not "Seen" yet. Now ZOOMER waits, writhing in agony from the snakebite.

CUT TO: ONE HOUR LATER

ZOOMER is still lying on the floor, now pale and sweating. The poison has set in and he needs to get the anti-venom NOW.

ZOOMER THOUGHTS
Don't have.... much... time.... Must ... hurry. But can't call... That would be... too awkward.

He looks on his phone. The message is still "Delivered". He types:

"Sorry to bother you again, but what time could you be here. It's quite urgent."

CUT TO: ONE HOUR LATER

ZOOMER is still on the ground, even paler and more sweating. These are his last moments. He can barely lift his phone. The message is still on "Delivered." He sighs. This is the end.

Then the message status changes to: Seen. ZOOMER perks up. We see "Typing...". ZOOMER has hope again.

A reply appears: "That sounds serious."

Another reply appears: "Do you need help?"

ZOOMER starts typing frantically. He may yet live:

"Yes!". Send. "Can you come?" Send.

Message status changes to "Delivered."

ZOOMER waits tensely for the reply. He waits for several moments, holding his breath.

But the message stays on "Delivered." Slowly ZOOMER loses all his strength and he slumps down. The phone slides out of his hand.

As he dies, we see the message status is still on "Delivered."

FADE TO BLACK

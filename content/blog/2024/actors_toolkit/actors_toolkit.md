This fall I will be teaching a 7 week course called the Actor's Toolkit for the theatre association Theaterwerkplaats Haarlem.

I will be teaching basic acting techniques. The aim is to give new and intermediate actors the abilities to improve their acting skills and hand them tools that they can use in future work.

I will mostly be working with Stanislavsky's system, with modern body and breath work, some mindfulness, and techniques from physical comedy based on John Wright.

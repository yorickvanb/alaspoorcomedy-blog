Performance of "What's Love Got To Do With It?", a production of the City Academy Theatre. It's the day of a wedding, and everything that can go wrong will go wrong.

I play the role of Bas, a loud, confident groomsman, who, on the morning of the wedding tells the groom it's not all that cracked up to be married. Think about your freedom, man.

On Monday 15th September, I performed in a short film being made by City Academy Short Film Course students led by tutor Marc Price. The aim of the project was to stage and film a fight scene.

The premise was that of a secret agent trying to retrieve a device of great importance.

The result turned into a quite kick-ass fight scene!

# Improv Group

Alas Poor Comedy has an improv group! The group is comprised of amazing improvisers of different nationalities. Together they peform (in English!) a show which will be completely improvised! Nothing is written down, everything is made up on the spot.

Whatever they do will be performed live for the very first time, and both for the last time.

What they have agreed on is that it will be a combination of short-form improvisation (separate scenes or games) and long-form improvisation (several scenes strung together).
